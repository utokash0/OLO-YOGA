        <div class="pharagraph-1"><h2>Meditation Nurtures the Brain </h2><span>We’ve all heard that
             meditation leads to greater mental clarity, lower levels of stress and reduced anxiety. 
             But how does meditation benefit the brain? Studies have shown that mindfulness practice 
             brings about positive physiological changes that make the connection between meditation 
             and the brain even more profound.
            In recent decades, meditation has become more conventional. People are spending time working
             with their minds, following their breath and learning to appreciate the power of the present 
             moment. Online meditation courses and groups are popping up everywhere – in schools, 
             communities, senior centers and beyond. It’s become so mainstream that even the business 
             community has joined the movement – as described in a recent article from Business Insider entitled 
             “Silicon Valley is obsessed with meditation, and there’s new evidence it changes the brain for 
             the better.”
            Research in the field of psychology has confirmed what every meditator knows: meditation is
             good for body and soul. Science is now able to reinforce the claims by showing how meditation
              physically impacts the extraordinarily complex organ between our ears. Recent scientific 
              evidence confirms that meditation nurtures the parts of the brain that contribute to 
              well-being. Furthermore, it seems that a regular meditation practice can help to heal 
              the mind-body continuum, and deprive the stress and anxiety-related parts of the brain 
              of their nourishment.
            Let’s have a brief look at some of the science.</span>

        <div class="pharagraph-2"><h2>Effects of  meditation  on the brain </h2> <span>In an interview in 
            the Washington Post, Harvard neuroscientist Sara Lazar gives an introduction to how meditation
             affects the brain. She explains how four regions of meditators’ brains associated with healthy
              brain function become more substantial, while one of the areas associated with undesirable 
              behavior actually shrinks. Let’s have a look at these areas.</span>

        <div class="pharagraph-3"><h2>Left Hippocampus </h2><span>This is the area in the brain that helps 
            us learn. The tools that we use for cognitive ability and memory are found here, as are emotional 
            regulators associated with self-awareness and empathy. Research confirms that as the cortical 
            thickness of the hippocampus grows in volume through meditation, gray-matter density increases
             and all of these important functions are nurtured.</span>

       <div class="pharagraph-4"><h2>Posterior Cingulate</h2><span>The posterior cingulate is connected
         with wandering thoughts and self-relevance – that is, the degree of subjectivity and referral to
          oneself when processing information. It seems that the larger and stronger the posterior cingulate, 
          the less the mind wanders and the more realistic the sense of self can be.
        Two of the vitally important effects that meditation has on the mind are the ability to remain attuned
         to the present moment without judgment, regret or anticipation; and the ability to observe sensations
          and emotions that arise in the mindstream without necessarily identifying with them. Meditation seems
           to increase the density of the posterior cingulate.</span>

        <div class="pharagraph-5"><h2>Pons</h2><span>This is a very busy and important part of the 
            brain where many of the neurotransmitters that help regulate brain activity are produced.
             Located in the middle of the brain stem, its name, pons, comes from the Latin for “bridge.” 
             The pons is involved in a great number of essential functions, including sleep, facial 
             expressions, processing sensory input, and basic physical functioning. Meditation strengthens
              the pons.</span>
